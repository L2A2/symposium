# Keynote Speaker

## Anthony Cohn

We are very pleased to announce that [Anthony Cohn](https://engineering.leeds.ac.uk/staff/76/), Professor of Automated Reasoning at the University of Leeds, will be giving the keynote lecture for the symposium. Anthony has worked for many years in the general domain of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on knowledge representation and reasoning. He has been behind seminal research in spatial logic and reasoning, ontology construction, and robotics; his work has led to his involvement in a diverse range of disciplines, including computer vision, engineering, and archaeology. Of particular interest to our symposium is his work in language acquisition for artificial agents and embodied representation.  In recent years, in recognition of his contributions to the field, he has been the recipient of the AAAI Distinguished Service Award (2012) and the IJCAI Donald E. Walker Distinguished Service Award (2015). He is, in addition to a number of other accolades, a past Chair and current Fellow of AISB, making his involvement in the conference this year especially meaningful.

# Call for Papers

### AISB Symposium on Language Learning for Aritificial Agents (L2A2)
### Final Call for Papers - **Deadline extended to 8 February**

We are pleased to announce the inception of a new Symposium on Language Learning for Artificial Agents, to be held as part of the 2019 edition of the annual conference of the Society for Artificial Intelligence and Simulated Behaviour (AISB).  The conference will take place at Falmouth University, Cornwall, UK, 16-18 April, 2019.

Our symposium will be a venue for presenting and discussing recent and ongoing work in the various areas related to the development of artificial linguistic agents.  At the heart of this event is the topic of grounded language learning and the host of computational techniques that are being explored as approaches to this scientifically and socially significant area of research.

We anticipate an event exploring the boundary between theory and practice, embracing enthusiasm for recent and ongoing progress in the application of computational techniques to linguistic modelling while at the same time welcoming thoughtful analysis of the ramifications – scientific, social, and philosophical – of the advent of linguistic communication between humans and artificial agents.  With this in mind, we invite authors from any field to submit academic papers presenting complete or ongoing empirical work, theoretical research, descriptions of datasets, postion papers, and other material relevant to this topic.  Subjects of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Representation learning
- Ontology construction
- Construction grammar
- Learning language from multimodal data
- Multi-lingual approaches to grounded language learning
- Deep learning approaches to grounded language learning
- Embodied approaches to natural language processing
- Modelling non-linguistic components of language learning
- Symbol grounding/ungrounding problems
- Language games
- Embodied conversational agents
- Human interactions with artificial agents
- Computational models of developmental linguistics
- Modelling language on multiple timescales
- Evolutionary computational linguistics
- Social considerations in developing artificial linguistic agents

Keynote Speaker: **Luc Steels**  
We are very pleased to announce that Luc Steels, Senior Research Professor at the [Institut de Biologia Evolutiva (UPF-CSIC)](https://www.upf.edu/web/icrea-luc-steels) Barcelona, will be giving a keynote lecture as part of the symposium.  Luc has been a seminal figure in Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Technology over the past four decades.  He founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Free University of Brussels in 1983, and since then has been involved in major projects covering the full range of topics at the heart of AI, from expert systems to neural networks and sustainable computing.  Of particular relevance to our symposium is his groundbreaking work on evolutionary linguistics, fluid construction grammar, and language-using robots. 

Important Dates:  
_submission deadline_ – 8 February, 2019  
_notification_ –  28 February, 2019  
_camera-ready_ final draft – 18 March, 2019

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of our programme committee.  Authors of accepted papers will be expected to give a 30 minute (long papers) or 15 minute (short papers) presentation at the symposium.  (Please note participating authors will be required to register with the conference.)  Papers will be published as part of the proceedings of AISB 2019.

Review will be double-blind, so please avoid including any information which might identify authors in submissions.  Submissions should be made according to the AISB style guidelines.  LaTeX and Word Templates can be found here (direct link to download):
